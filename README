dkparse is a small experiment trying to see how fast a
dedukti source file can be parsed.

06/01 Lua code can be generated using dkparse, the
feature is still experimental but on simple examples it
works. The code is generated on the standard output and
is meant to be executed by a Lua interpreter, note that
the file lua/dedukti.lua must be loaded first, a
typical use case is shown below:
    dkparse f.dk | lua -l dedukti

05/27 Syntactic support for dot patterns was added,
basic scoping and linearity checks are performed by
dkparse.

05/14 Now it also checks that identifiers are well
scoped, note that it does not handle external modules
yet.
